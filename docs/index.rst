Introduction
-------------

The artificial_random_signaling_network Github repo provides a Julia script to generate artificial 
random signaling networks with adjustable parameters, and also provides topological 
analysis by Python scripts. If you would like to use any of the code, please cite the article 
(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.084848) and the Github webpage 
(https://github.com/SunnyXu/artificial_random_signaling_network). Thanks.
